Project Proposal: Simple Online Store API

1. Project Scenario
This API serves a small online store, allowing customers to browse products, place orders, and submit feedback. Administrators can manage product listings and view detailed sales reports. The store aims to provide a smooth online shopping experience for users while enabling efficient store management for the administrator.

2. Problem Statement
The online retail market is competitive, requiring stores to operate efficiently and respond quickly to consumer needs. This project addresses the need for a flexible, reliable, and easy-to-use system that supports both customer interactions and administrative management. The primary goals are to streamline the product browsing and ordering process for customers and to simplify product and order management for administrators.

3. Technical Components

Data Models:
User: Stores user details, including name, email, password (hashed), and role (admin/customer).
Product: Contains product information like name, description, price, category, and image URLs.
Order: Tracks orders with fields for user reference, product details, quantity, total price, and order status.
Routes:
User Routes: Authentication, user registration, user profile management.
Product Routes: CRUD operations for products, search functionality.
Order Routes: CRUD operations for orders, including placing and updating orders.
External Data Sources:
Optional integration with external APIs for additional product details or payment processing, subject to availability of free tiers.
Advanced Features:
Text search for products.

4. Meeting Project Requirements

Authentication and Authorization: Implemented using JWTs, with separate access levels for customers and administrators.

CRUD Operations: Comprehensive CRUD functionality for users, products, and orders.
Performance Indexes: Indexes on frequently searched fields like product names and categories.
Advanced Features: Text search and sales aggregations to enhance user experience and provide valuable insights to administrators.

Testing: Aim for over 80% test coverage using Jest and Supertest.
